# timing-food-delivery
有时外卖项目源自B站黑马程序员的瑞吉外卖，由Spring Boot + Mybatis Plus构建，提供用户点餐、餐厅管理、订单处理等功能。有时外卖在原课程基础上，增加了完整的注释，补充了课堂未实现的功能，希望帮助大家学习。
The 'Timing Food Delivery' project is inspired by the Reggie Takeout from Bilibili's Heima programmers. Built with Spring Boot and Mybatis Plus in Java, it offers functionalities like user ordering, restaurant management, and order processing. This project extends the original course material by adding comprehensive annotations and implementing features that were not covered in the course, aiming to facilitate learning for everyone.
